Need Moar Materials Core
========================

A not-so-lightweight Minecraft Forge modification that adds extra materials, including titanium, silver, ebony, brass, platinum, and more! We are trying to add as much as possible into this mod, and we are open to suggestions, if you have one, scroll down and look at "Questions, Comments, Concerns?", and email us!

##Prerequisites
This Minecraft mod is made for Minecraft Forge, which you can download at [this link](http://files.minecraftforge.net/).
We are creating the mod in 1.7.10 latest, however 1.7.2 remended should work as well.

**It is very important that you get a 1.7+ version of Forge! The 1.7 forge code is very different from the 1.6 versions, and once 1.8 comes out, we will be immediatly updating to that version. Please stop emailing us about updating our mod, we are not going to do it yet.**
 
Also, go to the "[Releases](https://github.com/PlexiShard/Xtra-materials-mod/releases)" in GitHub, and download the version of the mod you want. It is highly suggested that you get the most recent version that is not a pre-release, because those will almost always work. It is very rare that one of those builds will not work.
 
##Installing
 
First, make sure you have all prerequisites downloaded and installed.
 
If you are using Forge (without Modloader) go to your Application Data folder, and go to the Forge version of minecraft  under .minecraft (or where ever you stored it) and place the .jar in the "mods" folder.

##Extension Packs
Soon, we will have an extension pack called BlocksonBlocks and Steam City, if you would like more information, email us at PlexiShardStudios@gmail.com!

###BlocksonBlocks
BlocksonBlocks is an optional extension pack, that also requires NMM core to function because of the blocks used. To install, go to "[Releases](https://github.com/PlexiShard/Xtra-materials-mod/releases)" in GitHub, and select the BlocksonBlocks Extension pack, *if you use the pre-release it may not work!*

BlocksonBlocks is a mod we have been wanting to make for a while now, it enables anyone to make a block of a block, so that will make it easier to store things and there are other things useful about it too, these blocks are stronger, harder to mine, less resistant to explosions, and other things! *It's still in alpha testing, and it wont be released until it works. (not any time soon)*
