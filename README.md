Need Moar Materials Core
========================

A not-so-lightweight Minecraft Forge modification that adds extra materials, including titanium, silver, ebony, brass, platinum, and more! We are trying to add as much as possible into this mod, and we are open to suggestions, if you have one, scroll down and look at "Questions, Comments, Concerns?", and email us!

##Prerequisites
This Minecraft mod is made for Minecraft Forge, which you can download at [this link](http://files.minecraftforge.net/).
We are creating the mod in 1.8 recommended version.
 
Also, go to the "[Releases](https://github.com/PlexiShard/Xtra-materials-mod/releases)" in GitHub, and download the version of the mod you want. It is highly suggested that you get the most recent version that is not a pre-release, because those will almost always work. It is very rare that one of those builds will not work.
 
##Installing
 
First, make sure you have all prerequisites downloaded and installed.
 
If you are using Forge (without Modloader) go to your Application Data folder, and go to the Forge version of minecraft  under .minecraft (or where ever you stored it) and place the .jar in the "mods" folder.
