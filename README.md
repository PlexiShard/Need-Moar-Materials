Need Moar Materials
===========================

A not-so-lightweight Minecraft Forge modification that adds extra materials, including titanium, silver, ebony, platinum, and more! We are trying to add as much as possible into this mod, and we are open to suggestions, if you have one, scroll down and look at "Questions, Comments, Concerns?", and email us!

##Prerequisites
This Minecraft mod is made for Minecraft Forge, which you can download at [this link](http://files.minecraftforge.net/).
You have to get the 1.7.2 download of the Forge.

**It is very important that you get the 1.7.2 version of Forge, or it will most likley not work!! This version is the only version we have tested so far, but more will be added in the future!**
 
Also, go to the "[Releases](https://github.com/PlexiShard/Xtra-materials-mod/releases)" in GitHub, and download the version of the mod you want.
 
##Installing
 
First, make sure you have all prerequisites downloaded and installed.
 
If you are using Forge (without Modloader) go to your Application Data folder, and go to the Forge version of minecraft  under .minecraft (or where ever you stored it) and place the .jar in the "mods" folder.
