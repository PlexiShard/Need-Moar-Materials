I recently started work on this again, using the root directory of mcforge/src/main as my git folder. 
By pushing all commits that I had created without pulling the pre-existing commits, I accidentally deleted the history... 
Well, at least it's far more cleaned up and actually works...

If you want to see previous releases, you can check the tags section. GitHub is good with keeping that stuff in cache
